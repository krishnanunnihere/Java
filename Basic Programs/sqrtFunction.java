/*Please note that whenever a method is called, a particular nomenclature is used where we first
specify the class that the particular method belongs to, e.g. Math.round( ); where Math is the class
name and round is the method name. If a particular method accepts parameters, these are placed in
brackets, e.g. Math.max(2.8, 12.9) â€“ in this case it would return 12.9 as being the larger number. A useful method is the Math.random( ) which would return a random number ranging between 0.0
and 1.0.*/
